# CrowdSourced_Emergency_Management_System
Recommendation system for Crowdsourced Emergency management

Submitted By: Priyanka Karpe

The proposed recommendation system is for crowdsourced emergency management. The dataset consists of 10000 users. The users are mobile and their locations get updated every 5 seconds. The proposed system provides a recommendation system which will provide a facility to host the event at a particular location, and a list of all the users who are present in a 5 miles radius from the event location will be invited.
